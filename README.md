# TTYCOON

TTYCOON is a web-based clicker tycoon game with RPG features, you start out as a poor script kiddie trying to hack his way to riches without getting caught by authorities. As you progress, you can purchase upgrades to increase your hacking abilities (Click Power and Hacking Skill), grow your botnet, and carry out more sophisticated attacks wich result in bigger rewards.

## Features
- Click hacking to gain data
- Sell your data for credits. As your hacking skill and compute power grows, the data you retreive becomes more valuable.
- Use your data to attempt a mass-scale attack by infecting multiple computers and grow your botnet.
- The larger your botnet, the larger your passive income becomes.
- Keep your heat meter low to avoid getting your data and perhaps your upgrades stolen.

## Still a work in progress.
